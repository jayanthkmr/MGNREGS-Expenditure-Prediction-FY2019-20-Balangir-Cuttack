# Approach 1: Block Level Aggregation to AC Level

## Overview
This approach aggregates predictions at the block level to estimate AC level expenditures, suitable for districts like Balangir with non-overlapping block boundaries.

## Data Requirements
- Block level expenditure data.
- Mapping of blocks to ACs without overlap (specific to Balangir).

## Running the Model
```bash
jupyter Notebook
```

## Expected Output
- Aggregated expenditure predictions at the AC level in CSV format.
- Detailed logs of the aggregation process
